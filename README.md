## METALLICA PROJECT

## DESCRIPTION
 
 This is our third project that consists on creating an app themed of Metallica band. Our main idea is to display an interactive application where the user can check Metallica's discograhpy and choose their favorite album collection. Once the album is selected you can read lyrics and listen the songs.
 Also, it is possible to add a favorite user playlist which enable to user to create and remove tracks in it.

## CHALLENGES

As main challenge that we had to struggle with in this full-stack project was to create both MVC ( Model, view ,controller) and CRUD's at the same time for first time in a project without using third-party API's.
To define how we were going to make up our mongoose schemas was also a bit complicated thing to get it done..
From the client-side we had mild setbacks such as import images because we didn't knwow how it works, or fetch data from back-end and display on screen in order to keep going making progress on the application..
Overall, due to the logic that we have already came up was not ideal to do CRUD because we cannot erase or add new music to the albums, so we tried to achieve it by adding or deleting new albums collection and favorite playlists in the app, in other words, that was something tricky to carry out.
